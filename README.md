## Overview  
The **Loan Application System** is a full-stack application designed to enable customers to apply for loans, make repayments, and track their loan status. It also includes administrative functionalities like managing loan approvals and viewing transactions.  


## Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **State Management:** React Context API

## Key Design Choices  

### **Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS**  
- **React.js:**  
  - Utilized for its component-based architecture and performance optimizations.  
  - Enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process efficient.  
  - Chose **Vite** over CRA for faster build times and an enhanced development experience.  

- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  - Utility-first CSS framework that allows quick prototyping and consistent styling.  
  - Highly customizable and responsive by default.  

---

### **Backend: Node.js with Express.js**  
- **Node.js:** Non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for handling numerous concurrent requests.  
- **Express.js:** Simplifies routing, middleware management, and RESTful API development.  

---

### **Database: MongoDB**  
- Flexible, JSON-like storage ideal for evolving data structures.  
- Provides excellent performance and horizontal scalability.  
- Primary Data Models:  
  1. **Users:** Stores user information, including credentials and roles (customer/admin).  
  2. **Loans:** Tracks loan details like amount, term, and state (PENDING/APPROVED/PAID).  
  3. **Repayments:** Tracks payment details, due dates, and statuses.  

---

### **Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**  
- Stateless and lightweight for securely transmitting user information.  
- Enables role-based access control (RBAC):  
  - Customers can manage their loans.  
  - Admins can approve loans and view all loan data.

### **API Design: RESTful API**  
The backend follows RESTful API principles with standard HTTP methods. Key endpoints:  

| Endpoint              | HTTP Method | Description                           | Access Level    |  
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
| `/register`           | POST        | User registration                     | Public          |  
| `/login`              | POST        | User authentication                   | Public          |  
| `/loans`              | POST        | Submit a loan request                 | Authenticated   |  
| `/loans`              | GET         | Retrieve user-specific loans          | Authenticated   |  
| `/loans/:id/approve`  | PUT         | Approve loan request                  | Admin Only      |  
| `/repayments`         | POST        | Make a repayment                      | Authenticated   |  
| `/repayments`         | GET         | Fetch repayments for a loan           | Authenticated   |  

---

### **Security: Middleware and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- Middleware ensures only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints.  
- Role-based access control:  
  - **Customers:** Manage personal loans and repayments.  
  - **Admins:** Approve loans and view all data.  

---

### **Deployment and CI/CD**  
- **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel.  
- **Backend:** Deployed on Heroku or Render.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  - Automated tests and deployment with GitHub Actions.  
  - Ensures consistent and error-free releases.  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- **Loan Approval Automation:**  
  Implement algorithms to automatically assess loan applications based on predefined criteria.  

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Expand functionalities to include detailed analytics like loan approval rates, repayment statuses, and overdue loans.  

- **User Notifications:**  
  Add email/SMS notifications to keep users updated on loan status, repayments, and deadlines.
